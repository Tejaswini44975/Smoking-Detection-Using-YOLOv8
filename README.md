# Smoking-Detection-Using-YOLOv8

First an image detection system using YOLOv8 is developed.The image detection model is trained on a custom data-set
and gets fused into PyTorch module.

Next the module is infused with the PYTHON code that utilizes Open CV for real-time video processing and detection.
When detected the automated email is sent using SMTP Protocol to the concerned authority
